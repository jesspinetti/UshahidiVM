# Setup and run the Virtual Machine #

## Things you only have to do once ##

1.  Download the appliance from this directory. The file is named “Ubuntu-Ushahidi-2.ova”. It is a complete virtual machine and is a large file, over 5GB. The \*.ova file is available a Google Drive folder [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1ueY-1drF7QVbzqsZC8FylkyHIMpyjv-Z).

2.  Download and install VirtualBox ([*https://www.virtualbox.org/*](https://www.virtualbox.org/)), a free program that runs virtual machines. I suggest using the latest version which is version 5.2.18 at the time this document was written.

3.  Start VirtualBox.

4.  Import the Ushahidi Appliance

    a.  Under the “File” menu, select “Import Appliance”.

    b.  You will be prompted to select a file to import.

    c.  Select the Ubuntu-Ushahidi-2.ova file that you downloaded in **Step 1** Above.

    d.  You will be asked about settings. Accept the defaults until you get to a screen that reads “Import”.

    e.  The VM will take several minutes to install

    f.  Once installed, you may delete the Ubuntu-Ushahidi-2.ova file as it is no longer needed. All the necessary files and information are stored elsewhere on your computer.

5.  Setup the network that all VMs share

    a.  The VM requires two networks - a NAT network and a Host-Only network

    b.  In manager window: File > Preferences > Select Network (list on left side) > Host-Only Tab > Select the green + button (top             left).

    c.  The list will now display the newly created Host-only network, click on the check mark box listed under “DHCP Server”.

    d.  Take note of the “IPv4 Address/Mask” as it will be needed to interact with your VM from the host machine/

6.  Configure the Ushahidi VM’s network adapters

    a.  The VM has two network adapters - one for the NAT network and one for Host-Only

    b.  Do not change **Adapter 1,** it should be set to “NAT”. Do not change Adapter 1.

    c.  Click on the **Adapter 2** tab and select the name of the Host-Only Network that was setup in **Step 5b** above.

7.  Verify the Ushahidi VM’s network

    a.  Select the VM in the lefthand menu of VMs

    b.  Looking at the VM’s information displayed on the righthand side, look for the tab labeled “Network”. This tab should contain two network adapters, verify that the first adapter has the text **NAT** and that the second has **Host-only Adapter** at the end. The network tab should look like the following (note: your network interface may have a different name).

## Things you do each time you want to run the VM ##

**Note:** The password to the default user account on the Ushahidi VM is
“**sigcse**”

8.  Start the virtual machine

    a.  Select the VM in the lefthand menu of VMs (it may be the only one if this is your first time using VirtualBox box) and select “Start”.

9.  Close the Welcome Menu that appears.

10.  A window will appear showing an Ubuntu Desktop. Under “Applications” &gt; ‘System Tools”, select “MATE Terminal”.

<p align="center">

</p>

You may also use the shortcut “Alt + Ctrl + t” to open a terminal.

11. Change directory with ‘cd’ into the directory **platform-client**

12. Type "**npm run watch**" into the terminal

    a.  After a few seconds you should see green text that concludes with `webpack: Compiled successfully`

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/cmacdonell/UshahidiVM/blob/master/images/installation/04.png"/>
</p>

**Note:** When you are finished running the server, use CTRL + c to stop the server.

13. (optional) If you wish to interact with the Ushahidi service from your host system, then you must do the following:

    a. On the righthand side of the screen, there is an icon that displays two arrows going Up and Down. Right click the icon, and select “Connection Information”

    <p align="center">
        <img src="https://github.com/cmacdonell/UshahidiVM/blob/master/images/installation/05.png"/>
    </p>

    b. Select the tab “Wired Connection 2”, and find the IP address under the IPv4 tab.

    <p align="center">
        <img src="https://github.com/cmacdonell/UshahidiVM/blob/master/images/installation/06.png"/>
    </p>

    c. Copy down the IP address shown in the output, as this will be needed to access the VM from your Host system. In our case the address is **192.168.56.4**

14. Depending on how you wish to interact with your VM, follow the applicable instructions below.

    a.  From within the VM itself, you can access the Ushahidi services by using the address of ‘**localhost**’.

    b.  From your host machine, you can access the Ushahidi services by using the address we found in **Step 13c**. In our case, the address is “**192.168.56.4**”

# Using the VM #

## Accessing the Ushahidi Website ##

15. Open a new browser (Chrome/Firefox/Safari/etc) in the VM by clicking the Firefox icon next to the menu on the upper lefthand of the screen next to “System”, or your preferred browser if you are using your host system.

16.  Navigate to the address we found in **Step 14**, followed by “**:3000**”. From within the VM, this address will be “**localhost:3000**”. From the host system, this address in our case will be “**192.168.56.4:3000**”.

17. After opening the Ushahidi website loads, you should be greeted with a world map. It should look like the following.

<p align="center">

</p>

18. Click the “Log in” button in the lower lefthand corner of the browser. To access the admin account enter the email "**admin@admin.com**” and the password “**adminadmin**”.

## Interacting with the Ushahidi API ##

19. You can access the Ushahidi API using “localhost” on the VM itself, or by using the address found in **Step 14**. In our case this is “192.168.56.4”.

20. When you are finished using the Ushahidi VM, power it down using Power button in the upper righthand corner of the screen. After it is clicked, a dialog box will show a 60 second timer. You can wait for this to timeout, or click ‘Shut down’ to skip the timer.
